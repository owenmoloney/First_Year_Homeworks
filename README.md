This was a homework last year for one of my C++ classes which I thought was a good example of using switch cases in C++. Looking at it now there are some points that definatley could be changed to make it more efficient. For example, getting ride of the switch cases from 1-9 and including them in the default using the phoneNumber.at(i) if it doesnt need to be changed.
